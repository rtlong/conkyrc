# Grab weather data from wunderground.com and format it according to the given XSLT
# Script written by rtlong
# Modified by rtlong
# The orignal script and xslt can be downloaded from http://pondol.com/weather.tar.gz

# Usage:
# ${execi 1800 ~/.bin/weather-report KMNOSSEO5}

# Find your LOCID on Wunderground.com. In this case, you want the weather station ID. In my example:
# *** http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=55369&sp=KMNOSSEO5 ***
# I want the 'KMNOSSEO5' ID code. You can find this is the URL as above, or on the WunderMap, when
# you select a station.
LOCID=$1

# where this script and the XSLT lives
RUNDIR=$HOME/.bin

# CURL url
#CURLURL="http://api.wunderground.com/auto/wui/geo/ForecastXML/index.xml?query=$LOCID"
CURLURL="http://api.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXCurrentObXML.asp?ID=$LOCID"

# The XSLT to use when translating the response
XSLT=$RUNDIR/weather-report.xslt

# filter (if you want to convert stuff to lower-case or upper case or something)
FILTER="|gawk '{print(tolower(\$0));}'"
